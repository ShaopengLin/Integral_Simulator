Web based application that simulates the process of calculating volume using integral. 
This involves finding or estimating the area under curve and rotate the area around a certain axis.

This webpage uses the Mid Point Reimanns Sum to create cylinderical shapes that estimates the volume based on the number of subintervals. 

By entering functions and intervals, the page draws the function on the grid, then click the revolve button to revolve the area under
the functions to create an estimation of the volume. Increasing the subintervals slide bar will make the estimation more accurately.
